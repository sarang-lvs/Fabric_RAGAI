# Powering Sustainable Futures: Unleashing RAG AI with Microsoft Fabric for Energy Management

RAG AI on MS Fabric: Building Knowledge-Powered AI Solutions
In today's fast-paced digital landscape, businesses have abundant data, but they lack meaningful insights. Large Language Models (LLMs) are plenty and their capabilities abound, and still, they often struggle with outdated information, or they lack context-specific knowledge. 
RAG or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation, aims to solve this quandary. This approach bridges the gap between language understanding and your company's unique information ecosystem. RAG is more of a pattern than a technology by itself, and naturally it needs a framework or platform to run with. This is where Microsoft Fabric enters the picture. With Fabric's robust capabilities, we can build RAG solutions that transform how organizations interact with their data. Whether you're looking to create an intelligent chatbot for customer service, a powerful research assistant for your team, or a dynamic knowledge management system, RAG AI on Microsoft Fabric opens a whole new set of possibilities!
